        \textbf{Brief description}
         & It is a distributed tracing and monitoring system released as open source by Uber Technologies, that is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems.
         & It is a distributed tracing and monitoring system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkinâ€™s design is based on the Google Dapper paper. \\ \hline
        \textbf{Pros}
         & OpenSource. \newline
        Docker-ready. \newline
        Can be used with some Zipkin functionalities, as it has a collector dedicated to it. \newline
        Dynamic sampling rate. \newline
        Browser UI.
         & OpenSource. \newline
        Docker-ready. \newline
        Allows lots of span transport ways (HTTP, Kafka, Scribe, AMQP). \newline
        Browser UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\ \hline
        \textbf{Cons}
         & Only supports two span transport ways (UDP and HTTP).
         & Fixed sampling rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\ \hline
